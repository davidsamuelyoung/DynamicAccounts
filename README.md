# DynamicAccounts
This describes the idea of a software that autonomously handles client-side user account security on any website.

DynamicAccounts would allow anyone to use the software to continuously monitor the safety and security of their online accounts.

#### Overview of abilities:

- Autonomously changing linked email addresses

## Who
The software would be completely open-source, peer-reviewed, and independently audited. 
Anyone who can prove themselves trustworthy and also has a skillset related to the software would be allowed to contribute.


## Where
The user would have a few implementation options for DynamicAccounts:

  1. Use the DynamicAccount servers located in data respecting countries
  2. Locally deploy the software onto the user's own server
  3. As a P2P between the user's devices

DynamicAccounts would be available for use on macOS, iOS, Windows, Android, and Linux-based operating systems.
